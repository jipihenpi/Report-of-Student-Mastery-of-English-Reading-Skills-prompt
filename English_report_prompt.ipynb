    "The individual data shows that the student has high levels of proficiency in direct information retrieval (A1, 0.99), overall comprehension (A2, 0.97), and indirect information inference (A4, 0.95). These strengths indicate the student's ability to effectively identify key information, understand the main ideas and purposes of texts, and recognize and interpret implicit information such as tone, mood, and authorial intent. These skills enable the student to effectively engage with a variety of reading materials and extract essential details from them.\n",
    "However, the student has not mastered the interpretation of concepts and relationships (A3, 0.35). Although they mastered the evaluation of the text structure (A5, 0.51), the probability is relatively low. These areas represent challenges for the student, as they may struggle to analyze and interpret the meaning of words, phrases, and ideas, as well as discern the relationships between various ideas and concepts. Furthermore, they may have difficulty recognizing and analyzing different parts of a text, such as the introduction, body, and conclusion, which could impact their understanding of how these components contribute to the overall meaning and purpose of the text. Addressing these weaknesses through targeted support and instruction can help students improve their reading abilities, allowing them to better comprehend and analyze complex texts.

    "\tSuggestions for teachers\n",
    "For teachers, they could scaffold the student's reading skills by providing activities that focus on interpretation, evaluation, and inference. For example, teachers could provide guided reading activities that help students identify the main idea of a text and make inferences about the author's intended meaning. Teachers could also provide activities that help students analyze the structure of a text and identify the author's purpose. Finally, teachers could provide activities that help students make connections between different parts of a text and draw conclusions based on implied information.\n",
    "\tSuggestions for parents\n",
    "For parents, they can create a learning environment that supports the development of their child's reading skills by providing access to a variety of reading materials, including books, magazines, and newspapers. Parents can also encourage their child to read regularly and discuss what they have read. Additionally, parents can model good reading habits by reading themselves and discussing what they have read with their child. Finally, parents can provide opportunities for their child to practice interpretation, evaluation, and inference skills by asking them questions about what they have read and encouraging them to make connections between different parts of a text.\n",
